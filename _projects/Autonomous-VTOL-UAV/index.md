title: Autonomous VTOL UAV
description:  This was a project I was heavily involved in during my 3rd year at Queen's University with the Queen's Aerospace Design Team. It is important to note how big of a group project this was, and it could not have been done without the fantastic team working on this project. At competition, we won the Prototype Realism award, however our flight performance was sub-optimal (due to a large crash). Despite this, the lessons learned along the way were invaluable.

## My Role 
During this time, I was the Navigation Lead, responsible for developing competition ready autonomous flight algorithms for the VTOL as well as simulating them to ensure performance. I lead a technical team of 10 engineering students, leading weekly standups, and giving out tasks. I also taught them about algorithm design, ROS2, PX4 Autopilot, simulations and system integration along the way. We competed in the AEAC Competition in Alma, Quebec, winning the prototype realism award, but falling a bit short during the flight tests.

## Maiden Flight Troubles 
During our maiden forward flight transition, our VTOL fell 50m out of the sky due to the harsh wind conditions. This was the day before all of us were leaving the Queen's University area for summer.

## The Comeback 
Luckily, myself and a few  other team members all live in Halifax, and we decided to drive the VTOL home and work on it every night for a month everyday after work. In the end, the structure suffered significant damage which resulted in general flight instability issues, however a lot of the intial flight performance was restored, and this repair allowed us to compete in the compeition at the end of May. 

## Competition
While we did not achieve the results that we dreamed for, everyone on the team was extremely proud of this project and it truly was the culmination of sleepless nights in the engineering building, passion, talented people, and probably too many energy drinks.

## The Dream Team 
Executive Team Members: 
Will Conway
Ryan Berry 
Grant Keefe 
Ian Keefe 
Mateo Shwartz-Mendez 
Conor Spalvieri 
It is important to note that this is a design team, and there were roughly 15 talented engineering students working on this on top of the exec team.
