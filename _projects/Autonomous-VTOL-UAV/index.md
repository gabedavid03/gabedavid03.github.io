title: Autonomous VTOL UAV
description:    This was a project I was heavily involved in during my 3rd year at Queen's University with the Queen's Aerosppce Design Team. It is important to note how big of a group project this was, and it could not have been done without the fantastic team working on this project. During this time, I was the Navigation Lead, responsible for developping competition ready autonomous flight algorithms for the VTOL as well as simulating them to ensure performance. I lead a technical team of 10 engineering students, leading weekly standups, giving out tickets, and teaching them about algorithm design, ROS2, PX4 Autopilot, simulations and system integration along the way. We competed in the AEAC Competition in Alma, Quebec, winning the prototype realism award, but falling a bit short during the testing. During our maiden forward flight transition, our VTOL fell 50m out of the sky due to the harsh conditions (and possibly 3 hours of sleep we were all running on). This was the day before all of us were leaving the Queen's University area for summer. Luckily, myself and three other team members all lived in the same city, and we decided to drive the VTOL home and work on it every night for a month and a half after our summer jobs to get it competition ready. In the end, the structure suffered significant damage which resulted in a loss of yaw authority for the aircraft, as well as other general flight instability issues caused by access vibrations. While we did not achieve the results that we dreamed for, everyone on the team was extremely proud of this project and it truly was the culmination of sleepless nights in the engineering building, passion, talented people, as well as energy drinks.
