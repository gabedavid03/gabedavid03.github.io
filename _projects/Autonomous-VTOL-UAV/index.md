title: Autonomous VTOL UAV
description:  This was a project I was heavily involved in during my 3rd year at Queen's University with the Queen's Aerospace Design Team. It is important to note how big of a group project this was, and it could not have been done without the fantastic team working on this project. At competition, we won the Prototype Realism award, however our flight performance was sub-optimal (due to a large crash). Despite this, the lessons learned along the way were invaluable.
