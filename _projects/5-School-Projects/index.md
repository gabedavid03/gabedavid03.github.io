## Queen's Engineering Competition 
In second year and third year, myself and three friends participated in the Queen's Engineering Compeition. It is a one day compeition where you are given a problem and set materials in the morning, and then by the end of the day you must present your protoype to a panel of judges for grading.

## Mechatronics Design 
This class is a semester long class every year for Mechatronics and Robotics students. Each year, the professor comes up with a different robotics based problem involving hardware and software designs that students need to solve in groups of 2-3. These problems are always open ended, and it is always cool to see how my classmates have approached the same problem each year.
