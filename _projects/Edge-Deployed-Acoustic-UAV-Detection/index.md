title: Ottawa Defense Tech Hackathon 2025
description:  This was a team project for the Ottawa Defense Tech Hackathon that took place in November 2025. The goal of the hackathon was to create a system to detect and classify UAVs based on their acoustic signature. By the end of the day, our team had a fully working prototype of our product, Cerberus, making detections in real time and publishing to a GUI to easily view the detections each node makes. Our team won First Place in the competition, taking home the prize of $10 000.
