title: UWB Positioning Board
description:  This is part of my Capstone project in my final year at Queen’s. The project is an indoor, gesture controlled drone swarm, and it is done in a group of four. My contribution is the indoor positioning, which uses Ultra-Wideband chips to allow each drone in the swarm to localize in a local coordinate system, defined by the placement of the “anchor” nodes.
