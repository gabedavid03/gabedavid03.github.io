title: Autonomous VTOL UAV
description:  This was a project I was heavily involved in during my 3rd year at Queen's University with the Queen's Aerospace Design Team. It is important to note how big of a group project this was, and it could not have been done without the fantastic team working on this project. At competition, we won the Prototype Realism award, however our flight performance was sub-optimal (due to a large crash). Despite this, the lessons learned along the way were invaluable.

## My Role 
During this time, I was the Navigation Lead, responsible for developing competition ready autonomous flight algorithms for the VTOL as well as simulating them to ensure performance. I lead a technical team of 10 engineering students, leading weekly standups, and giving out tasks. I also taught them about algorithm design, ROS2, PX4 Autopilot, simulations and system integration along the way. The aircraft and trajectories were simulated using PX4's built in SITL, using ROS2 to send control commands to the aircraft in order to fly the compeition route. Once the desired performance was acheived in simulation, we moved to our software test drone to validate the perforamnce, and then moved to our final flight platform.

## Design and Assembly 
Parallel to the software development, the hardware subteams began designing and manufacturing the drone. Watching this unfold, and getting to help with carbon fibre layups and small part design was one of the coolest parts of being on this team for me. I had never had much expierence with design or manufacturing, so this was really cool to get to witness and help out with first hand.

## Maiden Flight Crash 
After validating the quadcopter flight modes and attempting forward flight transitions on our test VTOL platform, we were ready to test the forward flight transision on the compeition aircraft. Sadly, due to harsh winds, during our maiden forward flight transition, our VTOL fell 50m out of the sky. This was a heartbreaking one. This was the day before most of us were leaving the Kingston area as well, which meant that restoring the aircraft to its former glory would be a difficult task.

## The Comeback 
Luckily, myself and a few team members all live in Halifax, and we decided to drive the VTOL home and work on it every night for a month everyday after work. In the end, the structure suffered significant damage which resulted in general flight instability issues, however a lot of the intial flight performance was restored. This repair allowed us to compete with this aircraft at competition, which was a big win in and of itself. This process was tiring and took a lot of effort, but it also allowed me to learn more about the aircraft's structure, how to reduce vibrations, exposed me to more hardware design, and made me think in ways I hadn't before.

## Competition
In late May, the team reuintied in Alma, Quebec for the competition. This was hands down one of the coolest expierences in my life. The compeition was hosted at a hangar and we got to do all of our final testing and adjustments in the hangar, seeing small planes land and takeoff all day. During our flight windows, I got to go out to the runway to set up the drone. We also got to meet like minded people from different Canadian universities and see how they approached the same problem in a different way, which was really interesting. During our flight windows, we did not perform as well as we wished, having another mini-crash in one of the trials. However, we did win the protoype realism award, which was a testamet to the work that was put in throughout the year. While we did not achieve the results that we dreamed for, everyone on the team was extremely proud of this project and it truly was the culmination of sleepless nights in the engineering building, passion, talented people, and probably too many energy drinks.

## The Dream Team 
Executive Team Members: 
Will Conway
Ryan Berry 
Grant Keefe 
Ian Keefe 
Mateo Shwartz-Mendez 
Conor Spalvieri 
It is important to note that this is a design team, and there were roughly 15 talented engineering students working on this on top of the exec team.
