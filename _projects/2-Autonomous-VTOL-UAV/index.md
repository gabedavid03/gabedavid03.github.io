title: Autonomous VTOL UAV
description:  This was a project I was worked on during my 3rd year at Queen's University with the Queen's Aerospace Design Team. I was lucky enough to work with a great group on this project, and none of the work I did would have been possible without this fantastic team. At the AEAC 2024 Competition, my team won the Prototype Realism award. Unfortunately, our flight performance was sub-optimal (due to a large crash). Despite this, the lessons learned along the way were invaluable.

## My Role 
I was the Navigation Lead for this project, responsible for developing competition-ready autonomous flight algorithms for the VTOL as well as simulating them to ensure performance. I led a technical team of 10 engineering students. In my role, I led weekly standups, delegated and divided tasks among the team, and I also taught the team about algorithm design, ROS2, PX4 Autopilot, simulations and system integration. The aircraft and trajectories were simulated using PX4s built in SITL, using ROS2 to send control commands to the aircraft to fly the competition route. Once the desired performance was achieved in simulation, we moved to our software test drone to validate the performance, and then later moved to our final flight platform.

## Design and Assembly 
Parallel to the software development, the hardware sub teams began designing and manufacturing the drone. Watching this unfold, and getting to help with carbon fibre layups and small part design, was one of the coolest parts of being on this team. This was my first experience with design and manufacturing, and it was fun to get to witness and help out with that process firsthand.

## Maiden Flight Crash 
After validating the quadcopter flight modes and attempting forward flight transitions on our test VTOL platform, we were ready to test the forward flight transition on the competition aircraft. Sadly, due to harsh winds, during our maiden forward flight transition, our VTOL fell 50m out of the sky. This was a heartbreaking one. It also happened on the day before most of my team was leaving the Kingston area for a school break, which meant that restoring the aircraft to its former glory would be a difficult task.

## The Comeback 
Luckily, a few team members and I all live in Halifax, Nova Scotia. We therefore decided to drive the VTOL to the Maritimes and continue to work on it. We worked on the VTOL every night for a month after work. In the end, although the structure had suffered significant damage, resulting in general flight instability issues, we were able to restore a lot of the initial flight performance. This repair allowed my team to compete with our aircraft at competition, which was a big win in and of itself. This process was tiring and took a lot of from the entire Halifax-based team, but it also allowed me to learn more about the aircraft’s structure and how to reduce vibrations. Some of my favourite takeaways from this “comeback” time included my exposure to hardware design, and the way that this type of work necessarily made me think creatively and outside of the box.

## Competition
In late May, the team reunited in Alma, Quebec for the competition. This was one of the coolest experiences of my life, to date. The competition was hosted at a hangar, and we got to do all of our final testing and adjustments in the hangar, seeing small planes land and takeoff all day. During our flight windows, I was able to go out to the runway to set up the drone. My team also met many like-minded students from various Canadian universities and saw how they approached the same problem in so many different ways, which was really interesting. During our flight windows, we did not perform as well as we wished, having another crash in one of the trials. However, we did win the prototype realism award, which was a testament to the work that was put in throughout the year. While we did not achieve the results that we dreamed of, everyone on the team was extremely proud of this project. It truly was the culmination of many sleepless nights in the engineering building, lots of passion, very talented teammates, and probably too many energy drinks.

## The Dream Team 
Executive Team Members: Will Conway, Ryan Berry, Grant Keefe, Ian Keefe, Mateo Shwartz-Mendez, Conor Spalvieri. It is important to note that this is a design team, and there were roughly 15 additional talented engineering students working on this project.
